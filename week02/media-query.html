            <h2>2 Nefi 26:33</h2>
            <p>For none of these iniquities come of the Lord; for he doeth that which is good 
                among the children of men; and he doeth nothing save it be plain unto the children
                 of men; and he inviteth them all to come unto him and partake of his goodness;
                  and he denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, 
                  male and female; and he remembereth the heathen; and all are alike unto God,
                   both Jew and Gentile.</p>

            <h2>Helaman 5:12</h2>
            <p>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer,
                 who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the
                  devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea,
                   when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no
                    power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because
                     of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation
                      whereon if men build they cannot fall.</p>
